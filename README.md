# WHat Am I Having Today?

This project was made to practice implementing the tech stack mentioned below. Also aimed to deliver an experience for the user to pick random recipes to make for the day. üçΩ


## Tech-stack

- Bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Scripted with `javascript`
- State managed by `redux` & `redux-thunk`
- Navigated sections with `react-router-dom@5`
- Connected API with `axios`


## How to launch this project locally?

Just like any other `create-react-app` project, you can find scripts they provided in the `package.json` under `"script"` seciton.
But here is a list anyway, this project prefers `yarn` as package manager but you can use whatever too. Run these in any terminal in the root directory and you are good to go. üëê


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More (Helper information provided by `create-react-app`)

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
